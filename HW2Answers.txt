Homework 2

1.32
You would need to go to the source code for class Circle and add the code to the fields:

private string name;

1.33

public void send(String);

1.34

public int average(int number1, int number2);

1.35
Our textbook is an object and the class is book.

1.36
Yes objects can have different classes. In chapter one the house example has classes of shapes that are objects of Canvas. 

2.6
public class Student
public class LabClass

2.11
First, the constructor has the word public then the same name as the class, TicketMachine. 
Second, the three fields are in the constructor: price balance total. 

2.17
Private int status;

2.21
public Pet(String petsName)
{
name = petsName;
}

2.22
public Date(String month, int day, int year)

2.23
The getBalance method and getPrice method are essentially the same. getBalamce returns an integer from 
field balence and getPrice returns an integer from field price. 

2.26
public int getTotal()
{
return total;
}

2.28
The first difference I see is in the header of the method. getPrice has int before it and printTicket has void befor it in the header. 
This means that the return for getPrice is an integer and the return for printTicket is void, or nothing.

2.29
No, the insertMoney and printTicket methods do not have a return statement. 
When you call the insertMoney method the program is updating the field, balance. 
When you call the printTicket method it just prints out the details of the ticket.
Both have the type void in the header meaning no return. 

2.33
public void increase(int points)
{
score = points+;
}

2.35
public void discount(int amount)
{
amount = price-;
}

2.37
public void prompt()
{
System.out.println("Please insert the correct amount of money");
}

2.41
public void showPrice()
{
System.out.println("The price of a ticket is xyz cents");
}
